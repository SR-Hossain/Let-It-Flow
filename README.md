Sure, here's the text formatted as a `README.md` for GitHub:

# Let-It-Flow

Let-It-Flow is a platform focused on mental health care, similar to StackOverflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

## Database Setup

1. Create a MariaDB database named `let_it_flow`.

2. After creating the database, run the following SQL command to see the available tables:

   ```sql
   MariaDB [let_it_flow]> SHOW TABLES;
   ```

3. You'll see two tables: `posts` and `users`.

   - `posts` table:

     ```sql
     MariaDB [let_it_flow]> DESCRIBE posts;
     ```

   - `users` table:

     ```sql
     MariaDB [let_it_flow]> DESCRIBE users;
     ```

4. Adjust your database information in the `server.js` file to match your setup.

## Running the Server

To start the server, open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will launch the Let-It-Flow platform. You can access it through your web browser.

Remember to take care of security considerations when handling sensitive data and deploying applications.

Feel free to contribute or modify the project as needed!

Copy and paste this content into a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository, and GitHub should automatically format it correctly.
